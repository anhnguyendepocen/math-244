## The Bootstrap {.build}

A widely applicable and powerful statistical tool used to quantify
the uncertainty of a given estimate or model.

### Basic Idea
With a dataset of $n$ obs to which you've fit an estimate $\hat{\theta}$.

1. Draw a bootstrap sample, of size $n$ **with replacement**.
2. Fit your estimate, $\hat{\theta}^*$ to the bootstrap sample.
3. Repeat 1-2 many times and assess the variability in your estimate by looking at the *bootstrap distribution*.


## Ex: Simple Regression

Is there a relationship between fractionalization and growth?

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
war <- read.csv("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/15/hw/06/ch.csv")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(war, aes(fractionalization, growth)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "orchid")
m1 <- lm(growth ~ fractionalization, data = war)
```


## Bootstrapping $\hat{\beta}_1$ {.build}
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
war <- war %>%
  select(growth, fractionalization) %>%
  na.omit()
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
betas <- rep(NA, 5000)
for(i in 1:5000) {
  boot_ind <- sample(1:nrow(war), size = nrow(war), replace = TRUE)
  war_boot <- war[boot_ind, ]
  betas[i] <- coef(lm(growth ~ fractionalization, data = war_boot))[2]
}
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=3.2}
df <- data.frame(betas)
ggplot(df, aes(betas)) + geom_histogram(col = "white")
```


## Bootstrap distribution

```{r}
mean(betas)
sd(betas)
summary(m1)$coef
```


## A common argument {.build}

*Parametric methods have assumptions that often aren't reasonable, therefore the bootstrap is preferable because it's assumption free.*

The bootstrap requires a sample that captures the important structure in the data. Difficult with small samples of skewed data.

But it sure is flexible . . .


## {.build}

Is there a relationship between fractionalization and growth in terms of the **correlation coefficient**?

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(war, aes(fractionalization, growth)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "orchid")
m1 <- lm(growth ~ fractionalization, data = war)
```

r = `r round(cor(war$fractionalization, war$growth), digits = 3)`


## Bootstrapping $r$ {.build}

```{r cache=TRUE}
corrs <- rep(NA, 5000)
for(i in 1:5000) {
  boot_ind <- sample(1:nrow(war), size = nrow(war), replace = TRUE)
  war_boot <- war[boot_ind, ]
  corrs[i] <- cor(war_boot$fractionalization, war_boot$growth)
}
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=3.2}
df <- data.frame(corrs)
ggplot(df, aes(corrs)) + geom_histogram(col = "white")
```


## Bootstrapping v. CV {.build .smaller}

Both are computationally intensive methods that involve sampling from your data set to learn more about your estimate/model.

### Cross-validation
Often used for *model assessment* and *model selection*.

- Partition data into test and train
- Fit model to train, predict on test
- Iterate though all possible *folds* (not for VS)
- Compute aggregate measure of predictive ability

### Bootstrapping
Often used for quantifying uncertainty.

- Draw a bootstrap sample of size $n$ from your data *with replacement*.
- Compute estimate of interest
- Consider distribution of bootstrap estimates over many samples


## Activity 1

Take a look at the `law82` dataset inside the `bootstrap` package.

Compute a statistic of interest and construct the bootstrap distribution to find its standard error.



## Activity 2

Take a look at the `law82` dataset inside the `bootstrap` package.

1. Fit two models, linear and quadratic, to predict `GPA` based on `LSAT`.
2. Compute the cross-validated MSE for both models using one of the three methods we've discussed.
3. Bootstrap this statistic to estimate its standard error.
